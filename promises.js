// Understanding JavaScript Promises
// By definition, a promise is an object that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation.

// A promise object has a state that can be one of the following:

// Pending
// Fulfilled with a value
// Rejected for a reason
// In the beginning, the state of a promise is pending, indicating that the asynchronous operation is in progress. Depending on the result of the asynchronous operation, the state changes to either fulfilled or rejected.

// The fulfilled state indicates that the asynchronous operation was completed successfully:

// JavaScript Promise Fulfilled
// The rejected state indicates that the asynchronous operation failed.


//* Creating a promise
// To create a promise object, you use the Promise() constructor:

// const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
//    contain an operation
//    ...

//    return the state
//   if (success) {
//     resolve(value);
//   } else {
//     reject(error);
//   }
// });
// Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
// The promise constructor accepts a callback function that typically performs an asynchronous operation. This function is often referred to as an executor.

// In turn, the executor accepts two callback functions with the name resolve and reject.

// Note that the callback functions passed into the executor are resolve and reject by convention only.

// If the asynchronous operation completes successfully, the executor will call the resolve() function to change the state of the promise from pending to fulfilled with a value.

// In case of an error, the executor will call the reject() function to change the state of the promise from pending to rejected with the error reason.

// Once a promise reaches either fulfilled or rejected state, it stays in that state and canâ€™t go to another state.

// In other words, a promise cannot go from the fulfilled state to the rejected state and vice versa. Also, it cannot go back from the fulfilled or rejected state to the pending state.

// Once a new Promise object is created, its state is pending. If a promise reaches fulfilled or rejected state, it is resolved.


// Note that you will rarely create promise objects in practice. Instead, you will consume promises provided by libraries.

//! Summary
// A promise is an object that encapsulates the result of an asynchronous operation.
// A promise starts in the pending state and ends in either fulfilled state or rejected state.
// Use then() method to schedule a callback to be executed when the promise is fulfilled, and catch() method to schedule a callback to be invoked when the promise is rejected.
// Place the code that you want to execute in the finally() method whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
