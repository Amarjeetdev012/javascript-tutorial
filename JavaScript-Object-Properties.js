//! Summary
// JavaScript objects have two types of properties: data properties and accessor properties.
// JavaScript uses internal attributes denoted by [[...]] to describe the characteristics of properties such as [[Configurable]], [[Enumerable]], [[Writable]], and  [[Value]], [[Get]], and [[Set]].
// The method Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() return a property descriptor of a property in an object.
// A property can be defined directly on an object or indirectly via the Object.defineProperty() or Object.defineProperties() methods. These methods can be used to change the attributes of a property.
