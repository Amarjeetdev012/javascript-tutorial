//! Summary
// JavaScript hoisting occurs during the creation phase of the execution context that moves the variable and function declarations to the top of the script.
// The JavaScript engine hoists the variables declared using the let keyword, but it doesn’t initialize them as the variables declared with the var keyword.
// The JavaScript engine doesn’t hoist the function expressions and arrow functions.
